# waves-react
A full ReactJS/NodeJs project.

This project uses ExpressJS in combination with Mongoose and MongoDB for the back end. 
The back end has been fully created and thoroughly tested using Postman for server requests. 
The front end was created using ReactJS in combination with Redux. The login, register, and home page and 
user dashboard have been created. 

The shop page and the product detail page still need to be added.
